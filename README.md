# SIC-Capstone-Group12-ASYAD-Delivery-Optimization
Our machine learning capstone is a reinforcement learning system for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP). We're using an attention-based encoder-decoder to optimize ASYAD parcel delivery sequences, minimizing travel distance. Includes training pipeline, visualization, and Google Maps API integration.
